# Ryu Presentation Questions/Roadmap
- what is your problem you're trying to solve (why bother)
- why is your solution interesting/better than whatever might else be out there
    - what is your key insight
- how practical is it, can you actually do/build this, can people use it
- how far are you from the finish line
    - @TODO: roadmap/goals
- (implicit, we hope) what can _I_ do to help/enable this



# other stuff
other point about continuous vs discrete:
- people talk about using discrete numbers but use them in a continuous space

- we want to use 
- the question of using integers or doubles _doesn't_ mean we're using continuous or discrete math, that is an orthonagonal question of **HOW** the numbers are represented in computers
    - demonstrating the error, representation (2040 @24 time string problem)
